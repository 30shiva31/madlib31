madlib = f"Hey I am {yourname}. I am {age} years old and I have no idea of drinking water properly. I learn't to drink water by watching in {socialmedia}. Before I used to drink water from my nose lol. I also recently discovered that the life on the planet {planet1} is not same as the life on the planet {planet2} because people living on {planet1} breath from {organhole1} and eat from {organhole2} where as people living on {planet2} do not breathe at all, they survive by drinking {fluid1} and breathing for them is not as important as it is for us. I also play {game1} and I always win against my friend {friendname}, looks like am a pro in this game, am going to represent {country} in upcoming olympics. My ambition is to become a {ambition}, and I am very {pick_best_worst} at working my targets everyday so that I can reach to my dream place some day, also I want to settle in {dreamcountry} because I love to enjoy {scenery} every day."
